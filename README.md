The HR/Employee Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline employee and HR activities. It features an Employee Dashboard where employees can view messages, update personal information, check salary details, review contracts, and monitor attendance. The HR Dashboard enables HR personnel to manage employee attendance, view and update employee information, handle job applications, and send announcements. Additionally, the system includes a Careers page that lists job openings, allowing new applicants to explore and apply for positions. This project is built using a modern tech stack to ensure efficient and effective management of HR processes.

Technology Stack:
- Frontend: The user interface is created using Qt Designer.
- Backend: PyQt6 is used to develop the graphical user interface, while PyODBC connects the front end with the Microsoft SQL Server database.
- Database: Data is maintained in a Microsoft SQL Server database.
